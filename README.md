 GMB - Go Media Backend

The *GMB* stands for the unsatisfied thirst for an open media backend, which expose a interface to communicate with and further more is free of all frontend restrictions. 

The project is at a early stage of development and probably not quite a alpha version. 

# Features

First of all, the *GMB* should cover all basic CRUD operations with the additonal REST-interface which it provides. If this these tasks are completed, there will be more work. 

Possible features: 

* Integration of a meta-data info (e.g MovieDB)
* Authentication<sup>1</sup> 

For feature request open a [issue](https://github.com/loose11/gmb/issues).


<sup>1</sup>An authentication will be discussed later, because the tool can be used only at the home network.
